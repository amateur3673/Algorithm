# Algorithm
Basic algorithm and data structure. This repository includes: 
- Basic algorithms about Sorting (Selection Sort, HeapSort and QuickSort).
- Basic algorithms about binary tree.
- Searching problem (Binary Search, Binary Tree Search).
- Basic Graph structure (find the connected components in an undirected Graph, a directed Graph, BFS and DFS).
- Finding the shortest path in a Graph (the ``Ford-Bellman`` algorithm, ``Djistra`` Algorithm,..).
- Building a minimum spanning tree algorithm (``Kruskal`` and ``Prim`` algorithm).
- ``Euler`` circle in Graph.
- ``Hamilton`` circle in Graph (in progress).
- ``Ford-Fulkeeson`` algorithm for finding maximum thread in network (in progress).
- Bipartite Graph problems: perfect matching and matching with the maximum weight, ``Hungary`` algorithm.
